1. Sales Performance Evaluation
A retail store tracks daily sales (in units) over two weeks:
 120, 135, 130, 140, 125, 150, 135, 140, 145, 150, 138, 142, 135, 148
a) Calculate the mean, median, and mode of daily sales.
    mean=138.07
    median=139
    mode=135
b) Determine the range and standard deviation.
    range=150-120=30
    standard deviation=9.18
c) Explain which central tendency measure best represents the "typical" sales day and why.
    median because it provides a location of values with less influence 

d) The manager claims the store is consistently improving sales. Based on the dispersion measures, do you agree? Why or why not?
     no because the store does not show consistent improvement



2. Classroom Exam Analysis

Class B: 60, 85, 90, 95, 100, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90


a) Find the mean, median, and mode for each class.
     mean=86.7
     median=87.5
     mode=85 and 90
b) Calculate the variance and standard deviation for each class.
     variance of class A = 31.11
     SD of class A = 5.58

     Variance of class B = 133.4
     SD of class B =11.55

c) Which class has a higher average performance? Which class shows more consistency?
      Class A shows higher average performance and more consistency


d) Based on your analysis, suggest which class might benefit from additional tutoring.
      class B


3. Employee Salary Review
A company’s two departments have the following monthly salaries (in $):
Dept X: 3000, 3200, 3100, 3050, 2950, 3150


Dept Y: 2800, 3500, 2700, 4000, 3000, 2900


a) Compute the mean and median salaries for both departments.
     Dept X
           Mean = 3075
           median = 3075
     Dept Y
           Mean = 3150
           median = 2950

b) Calculate the variance and standard deviation to measure salary dispersion.
     Dept X
           variance = 7291.67
           SD = 85.4
     Dept Y 
           Variance = 208666.67
           SD = 456.8


c) Discuss which department has more salary inequality. What could be the possible implications of this on employee morale?
       Dept Y has more salary inequality.
       Employees might have unfairness 

d) If you were the HR manager, what salary adjustment strategy would you recommend based on these statistics?
        consider raising lower-end salaries in dept Y to reduce inequality

4. Housing Market Analysis
House prices (in $1000s) in two neighborhoods are:
Neighborhood A: 250, 260, 270, 280, 290, 265, 275


Neighborhood B: 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 230, 310


a) Calculate the mean, median, and interquartile range (IQR) for both neighborhoods.
       NEIGHBORHOOD A
                   Mean = 270
                   median = 270
                   IQR = 20

       NEIGHBORHOOD B
                   Mean = 291.43
                   median = 300
                   IQR = 120

b) Which neighborhood shows more price stability? Explain using the measures of dispersion.
           Neighborhood A 

c) If a buyer wants to minimize investment risk, which neighborhood would you recommend and why?
           Neighborhood A because prices are more stable and lower risk

d) Identify any potential outliers in either dataset and explain how they affect the average price.
           neighborhood A has no outlier
           neighborhood B also has no outlier


5. Delivery Efficiency Report
A logistics company tracks delivery times (hours) for 15 shipments:
 24, 26, 25, 30, 28, 25, 27, 29, 24, 26, 25, 27, 45, 23, 24
a) Calculate the mean, median, and mode of delivery times.
       mean = 27.2
       median = 26
       mode = 24 and 25

b) Compute the range, variance, and standard deviation.
       range = 22
       variance = 26.29
       SD = 5.13

c) Use the IQR method to detect any outliers.
        Q1 = 24
        Q2 = 28
        IQR = 4
         Lower bound = 18
         Upper bound = 34
       45 is outlier

d) Discuss how outliers, if any, could affect the company’s assessment of delivery performance.
        outlier increases the mean

e) Suggest ways the company could improve delivery consistency based on your analysis.
         use median instead of mean 
         consistent training for drivers
         implement realtime tracking and feedback systems
