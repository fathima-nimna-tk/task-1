1. Sales Performance Evaluation
A retail store tracks daily sales (in units) over two weeks:
 120, 135, 130, 140, 125, 150, 135, 140, 145, 150, 138, 142, 135, 148
a) Calculate the mean, median, and mode of daily sales.


b) Determine the range and standard deviation.


c) Explain which central tendency measure best represents the "typical" sales day and why.


d) The manager claims the store is consistently improving sales. Based on the dispersion measures, do you agree? Why or why not?



2. Classroom Exam Analysis
Two classes took the same test with the following scores:
Class A: 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 85, 88, 92, 87, 90


Class B: 60, 85, 90, 95, 100, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90


a) Find the mean, median, and mode for each class.


b) Calculate the variance and standard deviation for each class.


c) Which class has a higher average performance? Which class shows more consistency?


d) Based on your analysis, suggest which class might benefit from additional tutoring.



3. Employee Salary Review
A company’s two departments have the following monthly salaries (in $):
Dept X: 3000, 3200, 3100, 3050, 2950, 3150


Dept Y: 2800, 3500, 2700, 4000, 3000, 2900


a) Compute the mean and median salaries for both departments.


b) Calculate the variance and standard deviation to measure salary dispersion.


c) Discuss which department has more salary inequality. What could be the possible implications of this on employee morale?


d) If you were the HR manager, what salary adjustment strategy would you recommend based on these statistics?



4. Housing Market Analysis
House prices (in $1000s) in two neighborhoods are:
Neighborhood A: 250, 260, 270, 280, 290, 265, 275


Neighborhood B: 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 230, 310


a) Calculate the mean, median, and interquartile range (IQR) for both neighborhoods.


b) Which neighborhood shows more price stability? Explain using the measures of dispersion.


c) If a buyer wants to minimize investment risk, which neighborhood would you recommend and why?


d) Identify any potential outliers in either dataset and explain how they affect the average price.



5. Delivery Efficiency Report
A logistics company tracks delivery times (hours) for 15 shipments:
 24, 26, 25, 30, 28, 25, 27, 29, 24, 26, 25, 27, 45, 23, 24
a) Calculate the mean, median, and mode of delivery times.


b) Compute the range, variance, and standard deviation.


c) Use the IQR method to detect any outliers.


d) Discuss how outliers, if any, could affect the company’s assessment of delivery performance.


e) Suggest ways the company could improve delivery consistency based on your analysis.
